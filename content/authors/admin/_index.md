## Biography
Iâ€™m a researcher specializing in air traffic management and deep learning, with a strong focus on trajectory modeling, and multi-agent learning. I blog about AI applications for safer and more efficient air traffic systems. I apply a mix of machine learning and deep learning to solve complex problems in avitaion. My research explores how AI can enhance decision-making, improve air traffic operations, and drive the future of autonomous air traffic systems.
