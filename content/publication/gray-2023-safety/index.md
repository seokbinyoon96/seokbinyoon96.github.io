abstract: This paper investigates a method for the safe integration of urban air mobility (UAM) into controlled airspace while also analyzing its impact on the capacity of conventional aircraft runways. The proposed method consists of two main steps- route design and runway capacity assessment. In the first step, the UAM route is designed to maintain safe distances from obstacles and conventional traffic around the airport. In the second step, the impact of the route designed in the first step on runway capacity is assessed. The proposed method was applied to a potential vertiport location at Incheon International Airport using real traffic and obstacle data. The results demonstrated that the proposed method could assist decision-makers in comprehending various safety factors that influence the feasibility of UAM operations.
